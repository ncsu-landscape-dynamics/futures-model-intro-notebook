    "## DESCRIPTION\n",
    "\n",
    "_r.futures.*_ is an implementation of FUTure Urban-Regional\n",
    "Environment Simulation (FUTURES) which is a model for multilevel\n",
    "simulations of emerging urban-rural landscape structure. FUTURES\n",
    "produces regional projections of landscape patterns using coupled\n",
    "submodels that integrate nonstationary drivers of land change: per\n",
    "capita demand (DEMAND submodel), site suitability (POTENTIAL submodel),\n",
    "and the spatial structure of conversion events (PGA submodel).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submodels\n",
    "\n",
    "  _DEMAND_\n",
    "  DEMAND estimates the rate of per capita land consumption\n",
    "  specific to each subregion. Projections of land consumption are based\n",
    "  on extrapolations between historical changes in population\n",
    "  and land conversion based on scenarios of future population growth.\n",
    "  How to construct the per capita demand relationship for subregions depends\n",
    "  on user's preferences and data availability.\n",
    "  Land area conversion over time can be derived for the USA, e.g.\n",
    "  from National Land Cover Dataset.\n",
    "  A possible implementation of the DEMAND submodel is available as module\n",
    "  _[r.futures.demand](r.futures.demand.html)_.\n",
    "\n",
    "  _POTENTIAL_\n",
    "  The POTENTIAL submodel uses site suitability modeling approaches\n",
    "  to quantify spatial gradients of land development potential.\n",
    "  The model uses multilevel logistic regression to\n",
    "  account for hierarchical characteristics of the land use system\n",
    "  (variation among jurisdictional structures) and\n",
    "  account for divergent relationships between predictor and response variables.\n",
    "  To generate a binary, developed-undeveloped response variable\n",
    "  using a stratified-random sample,\n",
    "  see module _[r.sample.category](r.sample.category.html)_.\n",
    "  The coefficients for the statistical model that are used to\n",
    "  calculate the value of development potential can be derived in different ways,\n",
    "  one possible implementation using R will be available\n",
    "  as module _r.futures.potential_.\n",
    "  One of the predictor variables is development pressure (computed using\n",
    "  _[r.futures.devpressure](r.futures.devpressure.html)_)\n",
    "  which is updated each step and thus creates positive feedback\n",
    "  resulting in new development attracting even more development.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "  _PGA_\n",
    "  Patch-Growing Algorithm is a stochastic algorithm, which\n",
    "  simulates undeveloped to developed land change by iterative site selection\n",
    "  and a contextually aware region growing mechanism.\n",
    "  Simulations of change at each time step feed development pressure back\n",
    "  to the POTENTIAL submodel, influencing site suitability for the next step.\n",
    "  PGA is implemented in [r.futures.pga](r.futures.pga.html).\n",

To estimate the influence that this local development pressure has, we include the development pressure r.futures.devpressure in our initial model estimates. Development pressure is based on number of neighboring developed cells within a specified search distance, weighted by distance. Its special role in the model allows for path dependent feedback between predicted change and change in subsequent steps.\n",
