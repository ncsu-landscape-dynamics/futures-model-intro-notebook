# FUTURES Model Introduction Using Jupyter Notebook

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/futures-model-intro-notebook/main?urlpath=lab/tree/futures_triangle.ipynb)

This is a Jupyter Notebook introducing FUTURES urban model in GRASS GIS
using Python interface. The repository is intended to be used with
Binder, but the notebook can be used anywhere once the dependencies
are met.

## GRASS Version

This repository is compiling GRASS when a Binder image is renewed.
The reason for compiling it is that packages from PPA don't allow
compilation of using g.extension due to missing files from
documentation. The version used is the latest release obtained from Git.
This may be eventually changed to a packaged version once the issue
is resolved.
