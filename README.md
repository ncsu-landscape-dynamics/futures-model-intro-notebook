# FUTURES Model Introduction Using Jupyter Notebook

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/wenzeslaus/futures-model-intro-notebook/master?urlpath=lab/tree/futures_triangle.ipynb)

This is a Jupyter Notebook introducing FUTURES urban model in GRASS GIS
using Python interface. The repository is intended to be used with
Binder, but the notebook can be used anywhere once the dependencies
are met.

## GRASS GIS Version

This repository is compiling GRASS GIS when a Binder image is renewed.
The reason for compiling it is that packages from PPA don't allow
compilation of using g.extension due to missing files from
documentation. The version used is the latest master from Git.
This will be eventually changed to a packaged version once the issue
is resolved.
